# Hi, I'm Danilo Pierpaoli 🤌🏻

I’m a Physics undergraduate at the Open University (UK) and an aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and signal processing (FFT).  
After moving from a finance degree and personal training career, I transitioned into tech and data through hands-on projects in healthcare and quantitative analysis.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Projects
- Developer Tech Stack Explorer & Dashboard (https://github.com/DaniloPierpaoli/Developer-job-market-analysis)
  A full-scale data analysis project using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey:

  - Data pipeline & cleaning with Python and Pandas

  -Interactive dashboard built in Streamlit/Plotly. Link: (https://developer-job-market-analysis-gsobxkwepp7dsfdus2dznn.streamlit.app/)

  -Features grouped bar and pie charts for languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks filtered by country and age ranges

- FFT Sound Signal Analyzer (https://github.com/DaniloPierpaoli/FFT-Signal-Analysis)  
  A structured, three-part Fast Fourier Transform analysis toolkit:

  -Guitar String Analyzer – Detects notes and chords from guitar recordings Link: (https://fft-analyzer-app-gqnbgv3c5dns4qswe8phvc.streamlit.app/)

  -M<athematical Signal FFT – Transforms synthetic functions (e.g., cosh) into the frequency domain

  -Stochastic Resonance Explorer – Simulates bistable systems with noise to find optimal resonance peaks

- IP Subnetting Calculator Link: [IP Subnetting Calculator](https://github.com/DaniloPierpaoli/IP-subnetting-calculator-APP)  
  A desktop GUI built with Tkinter that calculates subnets, broadcast addresses, and usable IP ranges from IP + subnet input—ideal for teaching and quick usage.
