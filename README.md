# Hi, I'm Danilo Pierpaoli 🤌🏻

I’m a Physics undergraduate at the Open University (UK) and an aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and signal processing (FFT).  
After moving from a finance degree and personal training career, I transitioned into tech and data through hands-on projects in healthcare and quantitative analysis.
