👋 Hi, I’m Danilo Pierpaoli

I’m a data analyst with a background in physics, finance, and rehabilitation science — currently transitioning into tech with strong foundations in Python, SQL, and data visualization.

My work combines analytical thinking with real-world impact — from analyzing guitar signals using FFT to building interactive apps for IP subnetting and designing rehabilitation data solutions.
