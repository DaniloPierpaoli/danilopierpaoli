# Hi, I'm Danilo Pierpaoli 🤌🏻

I’m a Physics undergraduate at the Open University (UK) and an aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and signal processing (FFT).  
After moving from a finance degree and personal training career, I transitioned into tech and data through hands-on projects in healthcare and quantitative analysis.

Projects
 Developer Tech Stack Explorer
An interactive data dashboard built with Python and Plotly/Streamlit using the latest Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Users can filter by country and age group to explore trends in programming languages, databases, web frameworks, and cloud platforms.

Fast Fourier Transform ignal Analysis
A three-part project analyzing signals using the Fast Fourier Transform:

Guitar String Analyzer: Detects frequencies, notes, and chords from recorded guitar sounds using a custom FFT-based pipeline. Check my app at the following link:[FFT Sound Signal Analyzer](https://github.com/DaniloPierpaoli/FFT-Signal-Analysis)  

FFT of Arbitrary Functions: Visualizes the frequency domain of mathematical signals to demonstrate the FFT on synthetic inputs.

Stochastic Resonance Explorer: Simulates noise-enhanced signal detection in bistable systems, identifying the optimal noise level for peak resonance.

 IP Subnetting Calculator
A standalone Tkinter GUI application that computes subnet masks, broadcast addresses, and usable IP ranges — designed for simplicity and educational clarity.
