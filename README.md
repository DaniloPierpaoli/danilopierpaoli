# Hi, I'm Danilo Pierpaoli 🤌🏻

I’m a Physics undergraduate at the Open University (UK) and an aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and signal processing (FFT).  
After moving from a finance degree and personal training career, I transitioned into tech and data through hands-on projects in healthcare and quantitative analysis.

Projects
- Developer Tech Stack Explorer & Dashboard
A full-scale data analysis project using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey:

- Data pipeline & cleaning with Python and Pandas

- Interactive dashboard built in Streamlit/Plotly

Features grouped bar and pie charts for languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks filtered by country and age ranges

🎸 FFT Sound Signal Analyzer
A structured, three-part Fast Fourier Transform analysis toolkit:

Guitar String Analyzer – Detects notes and chords from guitar recordings

Mathematical Signal FFT – Transforms synthetic functions (e.g., cosh) into the frequency domain

Stochastic Resonance Explorer – Simulates bistable systems with noise to find optimal resonance peaks

🌐 IP Subnetting Calculator
A desktop GUI built with Tkinter that calculates subnets, broadcast addresses, and usable IP ranges from IP + subnet input—ideal for teaching and quick usage.

Guitar String Analyzer: Detects frequencies, notes, and chords from recorded guitar sounds using a custom FFT-based pipeline. Check my app at the following link:[FFT Sound Signal Analyzer](https://github.com/DaniloPierpaoli/FFT-Signal-Analysis)  

FFT of Arbitrary Functions: Visualizes the frequency domain of mathematical signals to demonstrate the FFT on synthetic inputs.

Stochastic Resonance Explorer: Simulates noise-enhanced signal detection in bistable systems, identifying the optimal noise level for peak resonance.

 IP Subnetting Calculator
A standalone Tkinter GUI application that computes subnet masks, broadcast addresses, and usable IP ranges — designed for simplicity and educational clarity.
